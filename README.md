# Core Ontology

An ontology for general and foundational concepts and relations (e.g. place, time, classification).

The Core ontology models general-purpose concepts, relationships and ontology design patterns (e.g. place, time, classification, situation), which are orthogonal to the whole Polifonia ontology network. Indeed, it is imported and possibly specialised by the other ontology modules of the network.

### Information Realization ODP

The Information Realization Ontology Design Pattern is reused by the core ontology, allowing to represent information objects and their physical realization.

## Music Time Interval ODP

The Music Time Interval Ontology Design Pattern is reused by the core ontoogy, and allows to model the musical timing infotmation expressed in different notations.

## Examples of SPARQL queries

- Which is the name of an entity during a specific time interval?

```sparql
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?entity ?entityName ?time
WHERE { ?timeindexedname core:includesName ?entityName ;
core:hasTimeInterval ?time ; 
core:isTimeIndexedNameOf ?entity .
}
```
