# Core

The Core ontology module of the [Polifonia ontology network](https://github.com/polifonia-project/ON) models general-purpose concepts and relationships (e.g. place, time, classification, situation) orthogonal to the whole Polifonia ontology network, and is imported by all the other thematic ontology modules of the network.
